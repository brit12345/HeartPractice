# HeartPractice
A portion of a system for a game. It accepts a value as the HP of a player, 
and draws the corresponding heart images on screen (full heart, three quarters of a heart, 
half a heart and quarter of a heart). First iteration was done as a function 
that accepts a value (stand alone), second iteration is done more efficiently 
as a class, which is designed to link to a player class. 

Uses p5.js and p5 play.
